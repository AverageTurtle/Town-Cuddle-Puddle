# How to add a home, business, park, etc?
First you must choose to either submit a request or build it yourself

## Submit a request:
You can submit a request in the discord or github
### Discord:
**You must be in the private discord to submit request here**

This is the best place to submit a request and will be the most likely to be accepted.
1. For now just @ me in the discord this process will be refined in the future

### GitHub:
Open a pull request that includes a basic summary of what you would like the building to look like. The more detail you give the more it will look how you want!

## Build It Myself!
**This proccess is likely to change over time**
- All edits must be done in the Dev Scenes any changes to release are likely to be denied
- Make sure to add your build to quest and pc dev scenes to keep them in sync
- Try and stay within your own code as to no break others builds
- Add as few new mats are possible
- Any new mats added must have both quest and pc versions
- Use the VRC guides to optimize your builds
- HAVE FUN!!!
